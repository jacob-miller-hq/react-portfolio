This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
and set up with GH Pages with [gh-pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages)

I'm just trying to kill two birds with one stone by trying to clean up my portfolio page while also
learning some React.
